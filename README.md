Welcome to my "Codyssi" repository! This repository contains my solutions to the Codyssi coding challenges.

To run the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Provide your own `input.txt` file. This input file is not shared in the repository due to Codyssi's rules.
2. Use your preferred JavaScript runtime (TS-Node, Deno, Bun, etc.) to execute the file. All should work without any
   issues.

This repository is for educational purposes and to share my approach to solving the Codyssi
challenges. Feel free to explore, modify, and use any code you find here for your own learning and
projects.
